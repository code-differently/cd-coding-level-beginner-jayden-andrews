An elementary school teacher needs your help to create new strings for a fun activity they have planned.
You will be provided a non-empty string and a number N. To create a new string, you will start with the character 0.
Next you will add every Nth character of the string to the new string. Return the new string.

everyOther("abcdefg", 2) --> "aceg"

everyOther("abcdefg", 3) --> "adg"

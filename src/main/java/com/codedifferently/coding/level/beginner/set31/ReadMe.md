# Problem 31

You will be solving the given problem below.

## Problem

Create the string to look like it's going up; like a hill. To do this we need to take the last 3 characters
and make them uppercase. Even if there's less than 3 characters, just make whatever is there uppercase.
Doing this allows the string to look like it's going up and down depending on if begins with uppercase or not.

Tip: str.toUpperCase() returns the uppercase version of a string

Return a new string where the last 3 characters are now in upper case.

Example:

goingUp("Hello") --> "HeLLO"

goingUp("hi there") --> "hi thERE"

goingUp("hi") --> "HI"
